# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with Dark Mode

This repository contains a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented using Python's tkinter library. The game features a user interface with the ability to toggle dark mode, play the game, and reset the match.


## Description

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a classic two-player hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. The possible shapes are "rock," "paper," and "scissors." The outcome of the game is determined by the rules:
- Rock crushes scissors
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock

This implementation adds a graphical user interface (GUI) using the tkinter library, allowing users to play the game with a click of buttons. The game also includes a dark mode feature to switch between light and dark themes.

## Features

- Play Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.
- Dark mode for enhanced user experience.
- Reset button to start a new match.
